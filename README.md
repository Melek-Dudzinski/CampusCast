First time installation
1. Make sure you are in the latest version of main
2. Open terminal (you can open in visual studio code aswell)
3. Run 'npm install'
4. Run 'npm install axios'
5. Run 'npm run dev'
6. To navigate to the pages, enter in the folder you want to see e.g. to see the register page, you would do localhost:3000/register.

If you have already done the above steps, you only have to execute 'npm run dev' command into the terminal in order to run the react app. Make sure you are in the CampusCast directory first.
