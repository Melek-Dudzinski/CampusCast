1. Make sure you are in the latest version of main
2. Open terminal(you can open in visual studio code aswell)
3. Run 'npm install'
4. Run 'npm install axios'
5. Run 'npm run dev'
6. To navigate to the pages, enter in the folder you want to see e.g. to see the register page, you would do localhost:3000/register.

Once you have run 'npm install', you should also now have a folder called node_modules. If you already have this folder, no need to run 'npm install', only run 'npm run dev'
